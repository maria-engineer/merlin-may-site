Friday the 21st of May, to Abigail and Caleb Smith. From the moment he was born, he surprised his parents, for they were both expecting Felicity Smith.</p><p>This left them both dumbfounded when they were asked what the name of the baby was. They had to give him a name before he could be taken away by the nurses, and the baby would just not stop crying. The nurses were waiting, looking at them expectantly... Abigail was exhausted from the labour and already disappointed with the outcome. This was in fact just the beginning of the disappointment that the baby would become to her. As Abigail grew more and more irritable, Caleb&#x27;s anxiety grew.</p><p>&quot;We never thought of a boy name,&quot; admitted Abigail to the nurse. &quot;How about John?&quot;</p><p>&quot;John sounds good,&quot; agreed Caleb, though he would have agreed to anything Abigail said in that moment.</p><p>&quot;John, John Smith sounds right,&quot; decided Abigail. &quot;It just fits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;John Smith? Are you sure?&quot; asked the nurse in disbelief.</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes. It&#x27;s an old family name,&quot; fibbed Caleb, who could see Abigail about to snap at the nurse.</p><p>With that, John was taken away by the nurse for a checkup. He continued to cry. John cried a lot, he had experienced change for the first time, and like all other humans, he didn&#x27;t like it. In fact, it was teerrifying. Everything felt wrong. He was missing something, but he didn&#x27;t know what. Was he hungry? Was he cold? He didn&#x27;t have to worry about all of this before. In fact he didn&#x27;t even know what those feeling were before. John kept being prodded by strange people, so he continued crying. Then the prodding stopped.</p><p>&quot;I cried and now things are better,&quot; John thought. &quot;So crying fixes things?&quot;, he hypothesised. Which was a good hypothesis, primarily because crying was the only thing he had figured out how to do, and it was a relief to know it worked.</p><p>After what felt like ages, he was put somewhere soft and warm. Everything, from the lights to the feel of the fabric on his skin, had been too much. Even the sound of his own crying was starting to get to him. But the new place was more comfortable. The room quieted and so did John. The torture had ended. Satisfied, he fell asleep from the exhaustion of the day.</p><style data-emotion="css 1uqx2y8">.css-1uqx2y8{color:#99A893;text-size:20rem;text-align:center;height:50px;padding-bottom:1rem;}</style><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>The next day, he was cleaned and fed for the first time. As they made their way back home, Abigain held John close. With the close contact and the swaying motions of the car, John was happy. Not as happy as he vaguely remember being a whole lifetime ago, but that was the long lost past. Then the car hit a pothole. The shock of the movement and the loud noise startled John and scared him. So, he did the only thing he knew how, and started crying. Abigail shouted at Caleb for not driving more carefully and upsetting the baby. This made John cry more, which ended up with the argument becoming even more heated. The peace he had felt moments before was completely gone, and forgotten.</p><p>Like many babies, John could tell something was wrong, just not what. Whenever he needed something, he cried, in hopes it would get resolved. Abigail would systematically go through all the needs she could think of: food, cleanliness, warmth. But often that didn&#x27;t make John&#x27;s crying go away. This made Abigail increasingly frustrated.</p><p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; she would first shout at John in exasperation, but as the answer would not come it turned to &quot;Just shut up!&quot;</p><p>But John didn&#x27;t know, and couldn&#x27;t answer. So he did the only thing that he knew, and that was to cry some more. While Caleb was a bit more understanding, the lack of sleep had taken him to the edge as well, and when Abigail would have an outburst of anger, he couldn&#x27;t find the compassion to attribute it to exhaustion anymore, so he let it get to him. Caleb tried to take as many responsibilities off Abigail&#x27;s plate. But the relations between them did not improve.</p><p>It was the second month, and Abigail, Caleb and John were no closer to figuring out what was wrong when John was crying. The best they could do was a routine of changing the nappy, cleaning him up, feeding him, and warming his blanket. The two of them had barely left the house since John was born. Caleb&#x27;s return to work was approaching, and he was worried things will only get worse for Abigail and their relationship.</p><p>They hadn&#x27;t even spent any time with any of their friends since John came, and the social isolation was certainly not helping Abigail&#x27;s mood.</p><p>&quot;We could invite some of them around. You know the girls love a baby,&quot; Caleb offered.</p><p>&quot;And let them see how I&#x27;m failing to mother him? How disgusting I look with baby stuff all over me? The mess the house is in? You would like that, wouldn&#x27;t you? Parade your failure of a wife!&quot; Abigail spat back.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s not what I meant. I just thought having some company around may make you feel better. A few of them have kids too, so they could help.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah! Bring the help in! Because Abigail can&#x27;t hack it!&quot;</p><p>Caleb tried to explain himself, yet he somehow kept digging himself in deeper and deeper, until he eventually gave up. John watched, he couldn&#x27;t understand the words, but he saw the emotions.</p><p>On his first day back to work, Caleb ran into Charlotte, a neighbour and friend.</p><p>&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen you in ages!&quot; squealed Charlotte.</p><p>&quot;Been busy with the baby...&quot;</p><p>&quot;How&#x27;s Abigail holding up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhmmm...&quot;, Caleb was afraid to say anything, but the temptation of having someone listen to his stress and worries for the first time in months was too great. &quot;She&#x27;s not doing too well. And the social isolation is probably making it even worse... Oh, don&#x27;t tell her I said that,&quot; he quickly added.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it; your secret&#x27;s safe with me. How about this: I&#x27;ll drop by this evening after work, I have the perfect excuse, and I&#x27;ll talk to her, all of my idea? Don&#x27;t worry, I know how it is,&quot; Charlotte consoled him.</p><p>As promised, Charlotte dropped by that evening, supposedly unprompted, to ask them to come to the birthday party she was organising for her husband next month. Abigail was staring daggers at Caleb while she frantically tried to put the dirty laundry away.</p><p>&quot;Hello darling, don&#x27;t worry about it. You should have seen our house when Alice came. A pig would not have wanted to live there&quot;, said Charlotte.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s reassuring...&quot;, lied Abigail who inwardly thought that her standards of cleanliness were not up to par.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m here if you need to talk about it. You two don&#x27;t look good,&quot; offered Charlotte.</p><p>&quot;It feels like all John knows how to do is cry. We&#x27;re good parents. We see to all his needs and he still cries. I never thought it would be this tough,&quot; Abigail complained.</p><p>&quot;Took him to the doctor, and he said it was all good, he&#x27;s just taking a little while longer to adapt to the new environment, so he&#x27;s just expressing discomfort. The in-laws take him for a bit now and then, to let us sleep, but they are too old for a baby. And father-in-law is not in the best of health at the moment,&quot; explained Caleb.</p><p>&quot;You know, when Alice was young, she would cry all day and all night. She eventually grew out of it. Do you always pay attention to him when he cries?&quot; offered Charlotte.</p><p>&quot;Of course! We feed him, check his nappy...&quot; protested Abigail, clearly offended at the possible implication that she wasn&#x27;t a good mother.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I didn&#x27;t mean it that way! It&#x27;s good sometimes to just let him cry. If you always tend to him, he won&#x27;t have enough time to figure out that everything is actually ok. Just feed him, change his nappy, and come over for the evening to our place. We&#x27;ve rented the most recent Spielberg movie. If you don&#x27;t hear him, you won&#x27;t panic, and he&#x27;ll sort himself out. Worked like a charm for our Alice,&quot; advised Charlotte.</p><p>Abigail and Caleb were reluctant at first, but it had been ages since they had any fun time, much less with friends. Charlotte was a neurology nurse, so they thought she knew what she was talking about. The first night, they felt a bit guilty. They returned to John, hoarse, still crying. By the second time, he was asleep when they returned. Soon after, John learned that no amount of crying would make things feel better. His throat and eyes would just hurt more, and it wouldn&#x27;t change anything. So he stopped crying. To Abigail and Caleb, it was a miracle. They could finally sleep through the night. Charlotte was right, and she saved them. Having a child was not that hard after all. Once the nappies would stop, all it would need was a little more food, additional shopping for clothes and educational supplies, and that was it, easy. As disappointed as Abigail was by not having a girl to join in on her activities, she had to admit it was cheaper with a boy.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>John became perpetually quiet. His parents&#x27;s routine did not change if he protested, so he would just wait. If he needed something he would probably get it eventually if it was possible. His parents were elated by the recent development, and by how little trouble he caused. With all of John&#x27;s parents&#x27; friends praising John for being such a model baby, Abigail was beaming. John understood too, being quiet was good.</p><p>Things got difficult again when he started crawling around. He never seemed to be where Abigail expected him to be. John was so quiet, he seemed to pop out of nowhere. As he liked to follow his parents around he would often startle Abigail, or bump into her. Caleb seemed to encourage him, which annoyed Abigail even more, as John was always in the way.</p><p>Caleb was the one on the lookout for John all the time. That was quite the task, as John had an unquenchable curiosity. One day, John was in the kitchen again as Abigail was baking a ratatouille. The object of his curiosity this time was the oven. Caleb went to get John, but Abigail stopped him.</p><p>&quot;He&#x27;s never going to learn if you stop him every time. Let him touch the oven and he&#x27;ll figure it&#x27;s hot,&quot; she admonished Caleb.</p><p>As she predicted, John did indeed touch the oven. It felt incredibly hot on his hand. He pulled away, but even then, it stung. His hand throbbed in pain. He wanted to cry, and he did let out a soft quiet sob. But he reminded himself that &quot;crying is bad&quot;, and made things worse. So he regained control and stayed quiet.</p><p>&quot;See, he is fine,&quot; Abigail showed. &quot;He&#x27;s not even crying. It hurt a bit, and now he won&#x27;t do it again.&quot;</p><p>And that was true. John didn&#x27;t approach the oven again. He wouldn&#x27;t even wander into the kitchen on his own anymore. He would stay in the door frame, a safe distance away from the oven, and only enter if he was picked up.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>At age two, Abigail was getting worried about John. He had yet to speak a word. It was still within the range at which children began to talk, but Abigail was spiralling. Was his lack of speech a sign of an intellectual impediment? She always expected her child to be smart. Maybe it was too much to hope for a genius, but at least a smart kid. She worried she would have to deal with a child with a disability. What had she done to deserve that? Every day, she would try to convince John to talk. And every day she would get more and more frustrated. John seemed to have no interest in responding.</p><p>John understood what was being said to him. At first, he would become confused about what to say. He would think of some possible answers sometimes but had a hard time deciding, so he just stayed silent instead. At some point, he began wondering why his mother was so insistent on him talking. He had very little to say. She always seemed uninterested in the cool toys he was showing her, she wouldn&#x27;t care about their stories. What was so great about talking? He&#x27;d seen his parents talking to each other. Most of the time, they would just argue and shout. They didn&#x27;t even seem to bother to listen or understand what the other was saying. Talking was just noisy. He supposed he could speak to ask for the things he needed, but then he didn&#x27;t know how, or what for. After all his previous attempts had not been successful. And if there was no specificity, how was it different from crying? So, John decided he would only talk when he absolutely had to. The quiet was safer anyway. What if he said the wrong thing? It was easier not to say anything.</p><p>When he was two years old, it was also John&#x27;s first holiday with his parents. He was well-behaved, toilet trained, and could follow instructions, so Abigail decided they were worthy of a holiday together. The one big thing that was left to pack was the camera. She was looking everywhere, getting more agitated.</p><p>&quot;You always put away things in the wrong place,&quot; she snapped at Caleb, &quot;Now we&#x27;ll be late!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You had the camera last, you were taking photos of me with John,&quot; Caleb defended himself.</p><p>&quot;You must have picked it up and put it somewhere else. It&#x27;s not where I put it.&quot;</p><p>He escaped her anger by running off with the already-packed luggage, under the guise of preparing the car. John remembered he&#x27;d seen the camera on the sofa. He crawled across to the sofa and looked around. The camera had fallen underneath. At John&#x27;s height, he could easily spot the camera. He smiled.  He was happy to be useful. He picked up the camera and started waving it around. Abigail noticed him and violently grabbed the camera from his hand.</p><p>&quot;I was looking for this everywhere and you were just messing around with it all along!&quot; she shouted at him.</p><p>John&#x27;s hand was throbbing. He felt bad. He wanted to argue that he was only helping find the camera. But he had witnessed Caleb try to argue with Abigail and concluded any attempt would be pointless. To John, Caleb was an adult, so if Caleb couldn&#x27;t do it, neither could John. Thankfully, Abigail was too focused on getting all the other things ready on time, so she let John be. John was satisfied to be left in silence and said nothing. He&#x27;d found the camera. And the camera was found. Abigail was no longer venting her anger and stress at him, and he was fine. The result was the same. Why say something that could make things bad again?</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>At age three, John still wasn&#x27;t saying anything. Abigail and Caleb took him to the doctor, but they couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with him. They just said to give him time. He would likely start speaking on his own eventually.</p><p>&quot;John is completely healthy,&quot; the doctor emphasised.</p><p>John listened. He had nothing to add. He was healthy, he could talk... He just didn&#x27;t see the point.</p><p>Around then, John started kindergarten. Throughout the school day, John would sit quietly in his corner and do any tasks the minders would bring him. In their mind, he was the perfect student. All the other children were such a handful. Not having to worry about John, lifted a tiny weight off their shoulders. The other children either avoided John or enthusiastically tried to engage with him. He would listen to them and sometimes play along with whatever activity they were doing. But even among his peers, John felt no reason to talk. He was happy to listen, and he was even happier to sit in silence.</p><p>The teachers would praise John&#x27;s behaviour in class all the time to his parents. Sometimes they even asked the other children why they couldn&#x27;t be more like John. This confirmed John&#x27;s conviction that his silence was a virtue. Perhaps, his only virtue.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>At age four, John was still not speaking, to Abigail&#x27;s exasperation. She oscillated between treating him as if he was talking and forcing him to tell her what he needed, or he wouldn&#x27;t get it.</p><p>&quot;Do you want breakfast?&quot; she would ask.</p><p>John would nod.</p><p>&quot;Tell me you want breakfast, or you don&#x27;t get breakfast,&quot; she would threaten.</p><p>John thought he had. So he&#x27;d look back at Abigail, in confusion, which she interpreted as defiance, which only infuriated her more. This sometimes led to John not getting his meals. This didn&#x27;t bother John as much as it bothered Caleb. After Abigail was asleep, if John hadn&#x27;t had his dinner, Caleb would sneak him in a meal, often adding a few extra of John&#x27;s favourites.</p><p>This was their secret for a while, but Abigail eventually found out. How could she not? A massive row started between the two. It may have begun over Caleb and John, but by the end, no trace of the original argument was left.</p><p>&quot;Sure, be the hero. If you act like that, your son will never learn! But, no, I always have to be the big terrible villain!&quot; Then took her coat and slammed the door behind her. That evening Caleb and John had dinner together normally at the kitchen table, in complete silence. John could see Caleb was distressed, but he didn&#x27;t know what to say to make it better, and he worried he might make things worse. So, yet again, he remained quiet.</p><p>&quot;John, we won&#x27;t be doing secret night dinners together anymore. Sorry. I&#x27;ll make sure there&#x27;s always food in the fridge, I promise. You just need to get it whenever you are hungry,&quot; Caleb apologised.</p><p>John did not understand the apology, but nodded. He considered himself old enough to handle his meals and was even proud Caleb trusted him with the task.</p><p>After that Caleb acted more subservient to Abigail. But he started making more, greater acts of defiance in her absence. He took time off work in the afternoons on the days he was supposed to pick up John from kindergarten and took him to sign language lessons. Abigail had insisted that, according to the doctors, there was nothing wrong with John, so he should learn how to speak normally. She was certain that accommodating him would mean he&#x27;d get lazy and never speak, despite being able to. Caleb disagreed, but he rarely won any arguments. So he took John to classes secretly instead. John obliged and did his best to learn the hand gestures he was shown. Abigail found out about this too and an entire argument arose on the matter, even bigger than before. John must have been mistaken, but it seemed that this time Caleb was enjoying the fight. It seemed like he was baiting Abigail intentionally, but that could not be true. To John that just did not make sense.</p><p>After that, things were different. While they no longer had shouting matches. Every time they would say something they would make apoint of being meaner than the last, but never really speaking about anything other than practical matters. Abigail and Caleb would pick John up from kindergarten later and later. John didn&#x27;t mind it as much, as most of the children were gone by that point and the rooms were quiet. If he helped the teachers put things away, they would pet him on the head and praise him. This made John feel nice. The teachers as well seemed to enjoy the silence. So John concluded it was a happy arrangement.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>At age five, Abigail and Caleb had the biggest fight, for this one there was no more shouting left. Caleb took John to his grandmother&#x27;s place and left him there, so he would not have to witness it. John&#x27;s grandfather passed away from illness a year back, so she welcomed the company when she could get it. John never minded visiting, after all he was well looked after. After a few days, when John returned home, Caleb was no longer around, and most of his father&#x27;s things were missing from the house. Just like that.</p><p>Caleb would still visit John, but every time Abigail would start shouting at him for any reason she could find, so slowly the visits declined in frequency. After a while, Caleb found a new home. Now and then, Caleb would pick John up from kindergarten and take him to this new place. It was a strange old house that made John uncomfortable. Maybe not as much because of the place itself, but because of its unfamiliarity. Caleb talked a lot more to John than he used to. He wanted someone to rant at, and John listened well. If John signed even the simplest things, it would make Caleb very happy. It made Caleb feel superior. John knew Caleb didn&#x27;t understand anything past a couple of words like &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;thank you&quot;. John had dilligently learned the signs, he liked the idea of secret codes so he was excited to. But after making one too many mistakes, John realised the limits of Caleb&#x27;s vocabulary. So he would randomly gesture, and Caleb still happily noded along. To John communication became more of a performative art. Was it then that John decided never to speak?</p><p>Less than a month after Caleb left, Abigail brought a strange bearded man home.</p><p>&quot;John, this is Zach. He will be living with us from now on,&quot; she said. And that was it.</p><p>Zach&#x27;s large build was enough to terrify John at first.  But despite his burly appearance, Zach was very soft-spoken and gentle. This made John feel comfortable around Zach. Even when Abigail would get angry over one thing or another, Zach never raised his voice. John liked that about him. He thought Zach also understood the value of silence. So he was quick to accept him.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>At age six, Caleb moved away to a different, far away part of the country. John had already been seeing less and less of Caleb, but they hadn&#x27;t completely lost touch until then.</p><p>&quot;John, son, Daddy found a job, a really good job. It&#x27;s very far, so you will see less of me,&quot; Caleb announced.</p><p>It was then that John finally realised what had happened. It was late, but his parents never really bothered to explain what a divorce was, or that it was what had happened between them. A new person came to live in the house, and Caleb disappeared. That was the extent of the explanation. But now, this was recognisable and permanent.</p><p>Being the last to leave kindergarten, he had seen many other children brought home late by their divorcing parents. They would often tell John, the only other child there, all about their grand plans of getting the parents back together. Eventually, one parent would stop coming. The children would cry, yet they all still failed. So John accepted it, for there was nothing he could do. He just nodded silently.</p><p>&quot;I expected you to be a bit more disappointed, try to stop me...&quot; Caleb said under his breath.</p><p>&quot;But that wouldn&#x27;t stop you... so, why?&quot;, thought John.</p><p>The other children at the kindergarten tried to stop their parents. They argued, cried and complained. And that changed nothing. Caleb&#x27;s announcement was a statement. So was Abigail telling John that Zach was going to live with them from then on.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>At age seven, Zach brought home a computer. It was the most fascinating thing John had ever encountered. You would do something and the computer would respond exactly as instructed. Excited at how John took to the computer, Zach downloaded some educational educational games for him to try out. John was hooked. There were so many puzzles, some had numbers some images. They were all problems waiting to be solves. And the best part? There was guaranteed to be a solution. When John answered correctly, the program would tell him and reward him for it. This made John happy.</p><p>At first, Abigail, too, was happy with the recent development. John was showing that he was competent at maths, logic and technology. She was already making big plans for him. He would go to a prestigious technological university that would make him successful and rich. So she let him play.</p><p>Her excitement did not last long. John had gotten so enthralled by the computer screen, he would spend his entire day glued to it. He even started writing small programs on the computer under Zach&#x27;s instruction. At first, this made Abigail very proud. But when his programs became games that he would play for hours, while completely ignoring her, she became furious.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re wasting your time and talents with these stupid, childish games!&quot; she would shout and unplug the computer. &quot;Go do something productive!&quot;</p><p>If he wasted his ability on these silly little games, her dreams of him being accepted into a prestigious technological institute would be shattered. Abigail first let out her anger at Zach for bringing that computer into the house. Then she berated John for wasting so much time on the computer when he should read instead. She brought in books that she would get John to read under her supervision, like 1984, The Diary of Anne Frank, and other books she approved of. They were meant to build character and intelligence. John struggled with the text. He would have to spend hours trying to read them, but they did nothing other than give him a headache.</p><p>Zach brought &quot;contraband&quot; books, with the pretext of reading them himself. These books had wizards, dragons, robots and other fascinating creatures. One such book was the first one John actually read and enjoyed. After that, John would hide and read them after swapping the dust covers with that of a book his mother approved of.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>Growing up, John found less and less need to speak. It became a conviction that he didn&#x27;t need to. He believed it worked out better for him in the end if he didn&#x27;t. At school, he was doing well and was not drawing attention to himself. Hence, the teachers found no reason to call on him. They knew he wouldn&#x27;t talk, so they would speak for him, showing his work to the class and praising his behaviour. This lead the other pupils to resent him. John didn&#x27;t understand why. It wasn&#x27;t like he was doing his work well to show off, in fact he did nothing to show off at all. When he did his homework well and made no mistakes, Abigail was happy, and he was allowed to play on the computer. If he made mistakes, Abigail would be angry and punish him. So his work actually had nothing to do with the other kids, but he started to realise that reality would likely have been a lot worse to the others.</p><p>At first, the other children tried to make fun of him for not speaking, but John&#x27;s lack of reaction made them lose interest quickly. John avoided them, and they ended up avoiding him.</p><p>At this point, his grandma was the only one who hadn&#x27;t given up on getting him to talk. She would try these little tricks to entice him to tell her things. For example, she would ask him say the magic word that would make the greens disappear from the soup for him, which he disliked. But every time, Abigail would butt in and berate her mother for coddling him, insisting that he should eat normally and stop being fussy. John may have humoured her, if he didn&#x27;t think the outcome would have been the same.</p><p>Any time the fact that John wasn&#x27;t talking was mentioned, Abigail would go off in a fury. To her, it was a reminder of her failure. John was imperfect, and that was being rubbed in her face. Once anyone mentioned John&#x27;s inability to talk, nothing mattered. The good grades, his good behaviour, it was all overshadowed because he never spoke a word to her. Thus, John was something wrong.</p><p>&quot;Another top grade, if you could only use that brain to talk&quot;, she&#x27;d say.</p><p>As he got older, his lack of effort in communicating with her became even more apparent. He quietly listened and did what he was told, but never reacted, as if he was ignoring her. He was old enough and he could write. If he couldn&#x27;t speak, he could, at least, write letters or write on paper for her. But he hardly ever did that, short of the odd informational notes, like &quot;@ school for event. Back 7 pm.&quot; To Abigail, this meant he must have been doing it to spite her. She would try to get a raise out of him, but he still never said a word.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>John&#x27;s choice of university became a point of contention. Abigail had selected a few universities to which she wanted him to apply. John managed to avoid them when they started requesting video introductions from the students for the admission forms, which made it difficult for him to apply. Eventually, she had to concede to let him apply to the universities he wanted to.</p><p>There was one university that was happy to make concessions for John, especially since his skills were not lacking. He was applying for Computer Science, so they allowed him to opt out of presenting group projects, as long as he participated with the work. For everything else, they were certain he could manage. Abigail was still uncomfortable with the idea, as it was further than she could comfortably travel. But, ultimately, it was a good university, and the fees were smaller than the other options. So she gave in. And he went to the university of his choice. To John, this freedom of choosing where he wanted to go was granted to him by choosing not to speak. He was convinced he would not have been able to win the argument against Abigail, but silence won for him.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>John&#x27;s university life was the first time he felt accepted for who he was. The university focused a lot on students socialising, which John thought would be gruelling. However, there were so many other weird people, John found a group easily. They didn&#x27;t seem to mind that he wouldn&#x27;t speak, and just comfortably accepted his presence. The group would meet to watch movies together and have snacks or drinks. The others would discuss the film, and he would happily listen. They didn&#x27;t bother to ask John&#x27;s opinion, and John thought it was better that way. The humanities-oriented students always had interesting takes on the films. What he could say would probably be embarrassing by comparison. Whether he joined in didn&#x27;t matter. Whether he was there didn&#x27;t matter. To John this was a safe space to be, there was no pressure and no judgement, just enjoyment of their common interests.</p><p>In his course, he did well. But it was different from high school. While he could be the top back there, here everyone was as smart or even smarter than him. So he struggled with some exams. That scared him, as he&#x27;d never had to justify a poor result before, and the threat of failure was enough to terrify him. When he realised his mum had no idea of his grades just that he passed his exams, he relaxed.</p><p>He started focusing on the areas where he enjoyed more, and de-prioritise the rest, just enough to pass. Anything that was applied was his playing field. It was just a game of telling the computer exactly what to do, and it would do it. Try enough different things, and it eventually worked. The graphics courses were the best. They were the gratification he wasn&#x27;t allowed building games as a child. He would spend much more time than needed to put together practical work submissions that made him happy. He never got extra marks for the unnecessary work he put in, but he felt content.</p><p>Unlike high school, where people avoided him, he attracted positive attention at first. Others liked to talk to him. They would hang around him for a while, telling him about themselves. He would humour them, listen and nod along, but ultimately, they would get bored and leave. This suited him as well. He didn&#x27;t fully understand why they would approach him in the first place when he made no attempt to approach them.</p><p>During the group projects, he quietly picked up the work of the slower or disinterested ones. He was familiar with that, in high school, he would be the one doing all the work anyway. At least here there were a few interested in doing some work, and they showed up for the presentation.</p><p>In one of these group projects, John met Jayce. He was an extroverted, loud individual who was friendly with almost everyone in the course.</p><p>&quot;Wow, man, you sure got lucky getting assigned to John&#x27;s team. He&#x27;ll do all the work and all you need to do is take all the credit,&quot; Duke, said to Jayce, &quot;I was on my last project with him. I didn&#x27;t need to write a line of code. And we got 100% on the project. It was my best grade that semester and I did nothing for it. &quot;</p><p>Jayce laughed it off, but that attitude annoyed Jayce endlessly. He knew he wouldn&#x27;t be the most productive member of the team. His coding skills were lacking, he was not as smart as the rest, even so, he tried to make himself useful.</p><p>Rumours about John being the easy coast ticket had spread throughout the department to the point where people sometimes paid to switch to John&#x27;s team, without John&#x27;s knowledge. Jayce only found out when Duke cheekily offered to swap. Were it not for Duke&#x27;s attitude Jayce would have normally accepted, but this time he did not want to be agreeable.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve never worked with John before, give me a chance to reap the benefits.&quot;, he laughed.</p><p>Jayce didn&#x27;t believe a word but he played into Duke&#x27;s attitude, and Duke quickly relented. He quite the knack at figuring out how to act to keep everyone happy about him.</p><p>It was their second group project meeting, after the intro with the group supervisor, and nobody other than John and Jayce showed up. John seemed unbothered.</p><p>&quot;Hey, don&#x27;t you care people are using you for the projects?&quot; Jayce asked him, infuriated.</p><p>John just shrugged.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you have anything to say?&quot; Jayce prodded him.</p><p>John looked at Jayce pensively, then shook his head and returned his gaze to his laptop screen.</p><p>&quot;https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,&quot; John sent Jayce the link to the project.</p><p>Jayce clicked the link and saw that it lead to the source code to the group project. He ran the code and started to click through the application capabilities and with every one it became more of a challenge to figure out what wasn&#x27;t already done.</p><p>&quot;Wait, this is almost the entire project!&quot; exclaimed Jayce.</p><p>John nodded. His eyes returned to the screen to finish up the final touches.</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s only a few touch ups...&quot;, disappointment seeped into Jayce&#x27;s voice.  Jayce felt embarrassed. Did John expect him to be a coaster too?</p><p>&quot;Just you wait! I&#x27;ll make the best presentation this department has ever seen!&quot; said Jayce.</p><p>John looked at Jayce in confusion and then smiled at Jayce&#x27;s warm excited expression.</p><p>Jayce&#x27;s determination grew tenfold at John&#x27;s smile. If he had based his image of John on the rumours he would have likely pegged him for an antisocial perfectionist who thought he was better than anyone else, and the reason he would let others not do any work on the projects was just because he thought he would do them better. Meeting John, Jayce realised that wasn&#x27;t the case, though the jury was still out on the perfectionism part. Jayce labelled John as weird, but sweet in that moment, and it was probably sealed by the smile. At no point did John realise the importance of that smile to their relationship.</p><p>Jayce impressed John. He did keep his promise. If Jayce lacked any technical skills, it wasn&#x27;t evident. And he certainly had a talent in showmanship. John was mesmerised. John thought that if he&#x27;d had a voice like Jayce&#x27;s his silence wouldn&#x27;t have been the best solution. John did not dwell on the thought for long, for at this point his silence defined him.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>Jayce recognised John&#x27;s ability. Jayce&#x27;s dream was to build his own start-up, and John would be the perfect recruit, his ideal partner. Sure, he was quiet, but Jayce was loud enough for the both of them. And then some. So Jayce started sticking close to John, talking all about his dreams and the ideas he had. John had to admit Jayce was relentless and strangely persuasive.</p><p>Jayce would invite himself to John&#x27;s study sessions, using the lunch breaks to get to talk more to him about his start-up idea. Jayce would describe more and more of the apps he wanted to build. They were all random ideas, but they all had one common thread, they were helpful, tried to make things simple, and where possible they were fun. One dinner, Jayce took out his laptop to show John a small game he had designed, but couldn&#x27;t finish.</p><p>&quot;You see, I&#x27;m fairly good at designing these,&quot; he boasted, &quot;but I&#x27;m no good at getting them to work. To be honest, I wanted to study design or fine arts... my parents didn&#x27;t consider that a real degree, and they had me do Computer Science instead... Not that I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a bad thing! There&#x27;s a lot... &quot;</p><p>Jayce continuerd, but for the first time, John wasn&#x27;t listening. He started playing with the mock-ups that Jayce showed him. He loved them. They were so much better than anything he&#x27;d ever done.</p><p>The following weekend, John checked out the source code that Jayce showed him and started writing up the missing parts, fixing bugs, and built the remaining parts of the game based on Jayce&#x27;s designs.</p><p>Jayce dropped by John&#x27;s on Monday to walk to their lecture together. He found John sleeping over his desk, Jayce&#x27;s game running on the laptop. Jayce had been worried their friendship was one-sided. Guilt was starting to creep in that he was inconveniencing John and he just couldn&#x27;t say anything to make him stop. Seeing this, Jayce was touched. He was flooded by a feeling of stability in their relationship, followed by relief. No one had been as excited as John about any of his ideas, even if he hadn&#x27;t been vocal about them. Before he left, he put John&#x27;s pillow under his head and covered him with a blanket, as softly as he could so as not to wake him.</p><p>Jayce went to the lecture and took uncharacteristically detailed notes. He even stayed for the next lecture that only John took. He felt responsible for John sleeping through his lectures. John only made it to the end of the last lecture. Jayce sat down next to the paniked John as the rest of the students were emptying the auditorium.</p><p>&quot;Sorry for keeping you up all night,&quot;Jayce gave his signature smirk. &quot;I took these for you&quot;, he handed John the notes.</p><p>John took the notes careful, and after he realised what they were, looked at the ground in embarrassment.</p><p>&quot;I would love to see the game you made,&quot; said Jayce.</p><p>Jayce could have sworn he saw John blush. John enthusiastically took his laptop from his backpack and showed Jayce the finished game and the additions he had made.</p><p>&quot;This is amazing! You&#x27;ve done all this just this weekend?&quot;</p><p>John nodded.</p><p>&quot;Wow... I don&#x27;t know what to say... I always know what to say! I love it!&quot;</p><p>John had never felt happier. Inside him, there was a void that had been there for as long as John had been John. Today, for the first time, that void was filled. The enthusiasm they shared over this game spoke to him like nothing had before. This was the birth of the partnership between the two.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>John and Jayce started their own small company after university, as Jayce had always dreamed. Jayce would handle all the talking. And he would leave John alone to code as he pleased. Everything else they did together.</p><p>Jayce didn&#x27;t care about the company growing large. He preferred to remain a small studio where he would have full creative control. As they grew and hired more people, he put in an effort to ensure he would not keep the same safe and free environment. John was Jayce&#x27;s compass. If John was happy, he was still on the path he wanted. Regardless of how good things got, Jayce was certain, if he lost John, he would eventually fail, like all those massive corporations. John was great at listening to his ideas and bringing them to life. Even when he did things differently, it was always to make up for Jayce&#x27;s blind spots. He could solve all of Jayce&#x27;s complicated technical problems, and he would listen and rubber duck Jayce&#x27;s people problems whenever they came up. He was his perfect partent. And Jayce always made sure to let John know how much he valued him. This made John work even harder, as not to disappoint.</p><p>&quot;You know, even if you never really say anything, I feel like I can have better conversations with you than anyone else,&quot; Jayce once told John, &quot;Sometimes people just feel like they&#x27;re waiting for me to finish so they can say their bit.&quot;</p><p>To that, John just nodded pensively. The admission took him by surprise. That was something he had felt growing up, but how could Jayce feel that way? Jayce was the most talkative and extroverted person he knew. He seemed able to talk his way into everything. Didn&#x27;t that mean people listened? He even talked his way into John&#x27;s life. Yet he felt so similarly to John. This confused John. If he felt like that too, why did he still try to talk to others so much? What was the point when they wouldn&#x27;t listen and just make their assumptions anyway? The irony, that he may have made his unfair assumptions about Jayce too, struck him.</p><p>If he thought hard about it, his original impressions of Jayce were also incorrect, but Jayce stuck to him and talked until he got closer to the truth. John had believed that when it mattered, the truth would eventually bring itself to light. And when it didn&#x27;t matter, it didn&#x27;t matter if people got it wrong. Anything John could have said would do nothing to change that. But Jayce could, and even when he couldn&#x27;t, he tried. In that moment, he felt a crack form in his understanding of Jayce and of himself. A feeling he had never experienced before came to the surface, one of envy. But John was John, and he chose to let the feeling be overshadowed by curiosity instead.</p><div class="css-1uqx2y8 e1f8jir20">âœ¼</div><p>One day Jayce came to John&#x27;s place after a particularly gruelling meeting with some auditors, to vent, as it had become custom. John welcomed him with a warm cup of tea. John didn&#x27;t realise when Jayce&#x27;s presence became the norm in his life that they had built their own little routines. Not only did he expect Jayce, but he realised he&#x27;d been preparing dinner for two, despite Jayce never mentioning if or when he would drop by. But he wouldn&#x27;t have wanted it any other way.</p><p>John went to the kitchen to finish dinner and Jayce continued talking from the dining room. Jayce&#x27;s speech was strangely slurred. John wondered if Jayce had been drinking before coming over. Suddenly, the flat became uncharacteristically quiet. John was not usually uncomfortable with silence. This silence felt wrong.</p><p>He went to the dining room with the plated food to find Jayce slumped in his chair. A sense of dread overwhelmed John. He ran over to check on Jayce who was unresponsive, but breathing, his breath forming a rythmic condensation patch on the glass table. He grabbed Jayce&#x27;s phone and called the emergency services in a hurry.</p><p>&quot;My friend collapsed. He was slurring his words before it happened,&quot; he said in an unwieldy hoarse voice unfamiliar even to himself, further encumbered by the tears streaming down his face for the first time since he was a baby. </p></div></div><style data-emotion="css 14li4vi">.css-14li4vi{-webkit-align-self:center;-ms-flex-item-align:center;align-self:center;text-align:center;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.55);}.css-14li4vi a{color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.55);}</style><footer class="css-14li4vi ept4k9i0">Â© <!-- -->2024<!-- --> Merlin May, Built with<!-- --> <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a></footer></main></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/muted/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
