He was applying for Computer Science, so they allowed him to opt out of presenting group projects, as long as he participated with the work. For everything else, they were certain he could manage. Abigail was still uncomfortable with the idea, as it was further than she could comfortably travel. But, ultimately, it was a good university, and the fees were smaller than the other options. So she gave in. And he went to the university of his choice. To John, this freedom of choosing where he wanted to go was granted to him by choosing not to speak.

The university focused a lot on students socialising, which John thought would be gruelling. However, there were so many other weird people, John found a group easily. They didn't seem to mind that he wouldn't speak, and just comfortably accepted his presence. The group would meet to watch movies together and have snacks or drinks. The others would discuss the film, and he would happily listen. They didn't bother to ask John's opinion, and John thought it was better that way. The humanities-oriented students always had interesting takes on the films. What he could say would probably be embarrassing by comparison. Whether he joined in didn't matter. Whether he was there didn't matter. To John this was a safe space to be, there was no pressure and no judgement, just enjoyment of their common interests."),(0,i.tZ)("p",null,"In his course, he did well. But it was different from high school. While he could be the top back there, here everyone was as smart or even smarter than him. So he struggled with some exams.

When he realised his mum had no idea of his grades just that he passed his exams, he relaxed."),(0,i.tZ)("p",null,"He started focusing on the areas where he enjoyed more, and de-prioritise the rest, just enough to pass. Anything that was applied was his playing field. It was just a game of telling the computer exactly what to do, and it would do it. Try enough different things, and it eventually worked. The graphics courses were the best. They were the gratification he wasn't allowed building games as a child. He would spend much more time than needed to put together practical work submissions that made him happy. He never got extra marks for the unnecessary work he put in, but he felt content."),(0,i.tZ)("p",null,"Unlike high school, where people avoided him, he attracted positive attention at first. Others liked to talk to him. They would hang around him for a while, telling him about themselves. He would humour them, listen and nod along, but ultimately, they would get bored and leave.

Meeting John, Jayce realised that wasn't the case, though the jury was still out on the perfectionism part.
